# IMPACT_lab_research

Here is some of my work I have done with the IMPACT lab group. Our research involves experimental testing and computational modeling of asphalt pavements.

One project I would like to highlight is the Compaction Modeling Project. I am currently developing a model to capture the interactions of binder coated aggregates undergoing compaction. This project utilizes the “Bullet Physics” physics engine and Blender to help with visualization.
